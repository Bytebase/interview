# DevRel assignment

## Task 1

By reading [Bytebase.com](https://bytebase.com) and the related articles, write an introductory piece about Bytebase in **both English and Chinese**. The content should contain:

1. A summary paragraph about the product overview.
1. Introduce 3 core product features.

## Task 2

Find 3 international and 3 Chinese developer communities, write a summary paragraph in **both English and Chinese** about each community. The content should at least contain:

1. The unique aspect of the community.
1. The target audience of the community.

## Task 3

Design an online survey form to evaluate the develoepr communities you identified in Task 2. The survey will be sent to the developers. You need to decide which aspects to evaulate and design the survey questions accordingly. Also please be mindful about the form design itself (e.g. it's a red flag to ask a lot of questions since no one likes to fill a long form).

You can use **either English or Chinese** to build the survey form.

# Process

We will give you 7 days to finish the above tasks.

# Deliverable

For the articles, you can use whatever platform to host the article such as Notion, Feishu, GitHub page, your personal blog and etc, as long as you provide an URL that we can access.

For the survey form, we recommend using Google Form or [Tencent Form](https://wj.qq.com/) to create the survey. Other style is fine as long as you provide an URL that we can access.
