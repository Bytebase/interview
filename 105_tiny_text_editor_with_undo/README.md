# Tiny Text Editor with Undo

This project is to build a simple text editor supporting Undo/Redo.

# Minimum Requirements

1. An editor supporting plain text editing
1. Allow to perform undo/redo

You need to implement undo/redo by yourself instead of using the built-in text editor functionality

# Good to have

### Tech Stack

We don't enforce the tech stack in the assignment, but we recommend the tech stack used in our [main product](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase#-development) since that's the one you will work with after join. So you may try to get a sense beforehand.

1. Frontend - TypeScript, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS.
1. Backend - Go if you have pure backend background. If you have more frontend background, node is perfectly fine. It's also totally fine if your solution doesn't involve backend at all.

### Features

We don't require any additional features. If you have more time, we recommend you to polish those minimum requirements. But if you can't resist the temptation, just go ahead and surprise us.
