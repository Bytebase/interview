# Mini online paint

This project is to build a mini online verison of the classic Microsoft Paint. You can check out a fully-fledged version at [jspaint.app](https://jspaint.app/). This assignment only requires you to build a small part of it.

# Minimum Requirements

1. Support drawing line and rectange.
1. Allow to perform undo/redo.

# Good to have

### Tech Stack

We don't enforce the tech stack in the assignment, but we recommend the tech stack used in our [main product](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase#-development) since that's the one you will work with after join. So you may try to get a sense beforehand.

1. Frontend - TypeScript, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS. As for the drawing, there exsits couple options such as Canvas-based, SVG-based or even WebGL based, you are free to choose any approach.
1. Backend - Go if you have pure backend background. If you have more frontend background, node is perfectly fine. It's also totally fine if your solution doesn't involve backend at all.

### Features

We don't require any additional features. If you have more time, we recommend you to polish those minimum requirements. But if you can't resist the temptation, just go ahead and surprise us.
