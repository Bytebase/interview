# Take-home interview assignment

This is the home for Bytebase take-home interview assignment. Each subfolder contains an individual assignment. During our interview process, we will give candidate one of these assignments and let her/him work on it for a week offline. Our followup technical interview will discuss the various aspects about the solution the candidate built.

# Why we choose this approach

We have conducted hundreds of technical interviews in our career, mostly in the form of whiteboard live coding. While we acknowledge the merits of live coding interview (we do find some candidates with principal eng title from BigCo can't pass trivial coding test), it has huge limitation. In particular, the skill the live coding evaluates is distantly far from the skill required in the day-to-day work.

> **Whiteboard live coding requires to solve a very specific problem in a very constrained timeframe without external resources. It looks for specific(coding) problem solving skill under intensive pressure.**.

One would argue that's the trait picking the best from the good. Probably true for drafting people for coding competitions, not so much for assembling a team to build a product. Think about how we build a feature normally, we research the domain from the open web, learn our competitors, discuss with our peers. Coding is just part of the puzzle, and most likely we would never encounter any coding question in our work (have you ever written dynamic programming algorithm besides interview?). Even encountered, those arcane coding questions are just one [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com) away.

> **Day-to-day work requires solving a semi-specific problem in a semi-constrained timeframe with aboundant external resources. It looks for general problem solving skill under an open-ended environment**.

Most problems do have a defined domain, but there remains many uncertainties, and some of those revealation may totally change the scope. We do have a deadline, but at least it's in days instead of in minutes. And most importantly, we are solving together with the people, web around us.

In whiteboard live coding, both the problem and solution are already pre-determinted. While in take-home assignment, we only define a broad scope and some requirements, it's up to the candidate to craft the solution. That's what we expect for peers at Bytebase, to de/refine the problem, own the solution.

# Why we open source

1. The main Bytebase product is also open source. We are the believer building in the public.
1. Coming up good take-home assignments is not easy task. Open sourcing our assignments gives more chance for potential improvements.
1. It's convenient for our candiate to checkout the problem.

# FAQ

Q: Are you worry about candidate preparing the problem in advance gaining an edge?

A: Not at all. One can only prepare for couple weeks, but we are evaluating candidate's years of accumulation.

Q: New ideas, suggestion for enhancement?

A: Open new issue, creating PR, we will respond in a timely fashion.
