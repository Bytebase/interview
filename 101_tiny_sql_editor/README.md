# Tiny SQL Editor

This project is to build a tiny SQL editor.

# Minimum Requirements

1. An editor supporting SQL syntax highlighting.
1. A table list showing the result.
1. Can execute SQL from the editor against a database and return the result to display in the table list. It should support at least 1 database engine (could be one of MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite or whatever).

# Good to have

### Tech Stack

We don't enforce the tech stack in the assignment, but we recommend the tech stack used in our [main product](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase#-development) since that's the one you will work with after join. So you may try to get a sense beforehand.

1. Frontend - TypeScript, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS.
1. Backend - Go if you have pure backend background. If you have more frontend background, node is perfectly fine. It's also totally fine if your solution doesn't involve backend at all.

### Features

We don't require any additional features. If you have more time, we recommend you to polish those minimum requirements. But if you can't resist the temptation, just go ahead and surprise us.
