# ClickHouse quickstart

[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) is an open-source, high performance columnar OLAP database management system for real-time analytics using SQL.

We would like you to write a quickstart guide for newbie. To limit the scope, we target the following scenario:

> A newbie hears the buzzword about ClickHouse and wants to check it out, she doesn't want to mess up her local environment, so she wants to use docker to start ClickHouse, configure the user and use the configured user to connect and run some queries.

## Bonus point

ClickHouse has its own native client, meanwhile it also supports MySQL protocol. It would be good to provide instruction on how to connect ClickHouse using one of the MySQL clients (e.g. mysql CLI, phpMyAdmin etc). This lowers the barrier for newcomer to assess a new tool.
