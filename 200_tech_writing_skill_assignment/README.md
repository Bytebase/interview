# Technical writing skill assignment

Besides the tech project interview assignment in the root folder, we may ask candidate to write an article about a topic relevant to our field.

# Why we do this

We are looking for peers who can build the product and we believe product building and technical writing have many similarities.

Producing a good article first requires understanding your topic, your audience and your purpose. For technical writing, in particular, it requires clarity, accuracy and more importantly compassion. We are both the victim and the creator of the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). Putting yourself in your reader's shoes sounds nature, but often times, readers get mad because some important context only obvious to the author is missing. We encounter endless software with confusing UX because the software builder is always the expert in this domain, thus neglect the pieces not so obvious to the average user.

Bytebase is a dev tool specialized in database domain, and it requires a good understanding of the database and its role played in the software development cycle. However, our users may only have a basic understanding of the database. So it's very relevant for us to abstract the expert knowledge and deliver an intuitive interface to the normal developer.

# Process

We will give you 2 days to write an article. We may require a particular topic or you may choose a topic that interests you as long as it's relevant to our field.
